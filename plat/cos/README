The cos platform
=================

cos is a Cray X-MP based BSP that generates executables that can be run on a Cray X-MP
supercomputer simulator running the COS operating system.

COS has special needs, one being that it doesn't support byte-accessible files.
The port's read/write/open/close/lseek etc should handle this transparently.

File descriptors 0 and 1 are mapped to COS $IN and $OUT files, and file
descriptor 2 is mapped to the COS user log.

Example command line
====================

ack -mcos -o example.abs example.c
